#Getting Started

First, you need to install git, Maven 3 and Eclipse on your machine.

```
sudo apt-get install git maven eclipse
```

Next, clone the skeleton for the exercises:

```
git clone https://github.com/stratosphere/bigdataclass.org.git
cd bigdataclass.org
```

Import this project into Eclipse, using the "Import -> Import as Maven Project" menu.
This can take a while as Maven is going to download all the dependencies.
